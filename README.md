# AlternativeDataFrame

Created an alternative library for Data-frames and Series. There are different types of Series, in this case a Series containing only string elements
(and None), a boolean Series (with values True, False and None) and different numeric Series, namely one for floating point values and one for integer.

 Additionally, the boolean Series support element-wise and, or, xor and invert operations, and both numeric Series types support element-wise math operations (+, −, ∗, /), and inequalities (>, <, >=, <=, ! =), returning a boolean Series.
